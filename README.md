Journal Management System

Properties;

1- Editors can create journals and accept authorship requests

2- Users can be author to any journal (if the authorship request is accepted by editor)

3- I used Editor.JS for Content Management

I did not get live this project yet. If community wants to publish it, we can deploy it with your contributions.

For localhost setup please download all codes and create a virtual env. After that you must run following commands;

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver
